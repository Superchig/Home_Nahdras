Hello there anyone who is reading this.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ About ~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a game that a friend and I made. The code quality is horrible, as well as the combat mechanics and what could be called the plot.
It is a text-based choose-your-own adventure game with some combat elements. Ok, there's only two fights, and that's if you choose correctly.
If there's any bugs, please send me an email at chiggiechang@gmail.com or, if you actually know me, just tell me.

Please Note: THIS GAME IS UNFINISHED! IT IS BUGGY AND MANY PARTS JUST END RIGHT THERE!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ To run the game ~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Use run.bat

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Combat Mechanics ~~~~~~~~~~~

The combat is turn-based. You have two stats: health and stamina.
Each turn, you will be able to either attack or block. If you attack, then you will be able to input how much stamina you want to use.
If the computer chooses to attack, the side that chose to use more stamina wins, and they damage the loser by 1/6 of the winner's total health.
If one side attacks and one side blocks, then the blocker will lose 10 health but regain some of their stamina.
If both sides block, then both sides regain some stamina and lose no health.
You win if you can get your enemy's health to zero.
